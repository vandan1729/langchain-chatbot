# Chatbot Implementations with Langchain + Streamlit

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/vandan1729/langchain-chatbot?quickstart=1)

Langchain is a powerful framework designed to streamline the development of applications using Language Models (LLMs). \
It provides a comprehensive integration of various components, simplifying the process of assembling them to create robust applications.

## üí¨ Sample chatbot use cases
Here are a few examples of chatbot implementations using Langchain and Streamlit:
-  **Basic Chatbot** \
  Engage in interactive conversations with the LLM.

- **Context aware chatbot** \
  A chatbot that remembers previous conversations and provides responses accordingly.

-  **Chatbot with Internet Access** \
  An internet-enabled chatbot capable of answering user queries about recent events.

-  **Chat with your documents** \
  Empower the chatbot with the ability to access custom documents, enabling it to provide answers to user queries based on the referenced information.

-  **Chat with SQL database** \
  Enable the chatbot to interact with a SQL database through simple, conversational commands.

-  **Chat with Websites** \
  Enable the chatbot to interact with website contents.
